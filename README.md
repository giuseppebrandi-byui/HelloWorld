# Overview
As a software engineer I am trying to learn additional programming languages such as Rust. In this project, I am developing a simple application to print Hello World!.


My software includes a 'main' function (entry point) and print_hello_world function to print 'Hello World!' in the terminal.
It includes the cargo package manager which allows us to compile the project after we have made changes in the code by running the command 'cargo run'. 

The purpose of creating the small programs is becoming acquainted with Rust so I can then work on more complex projects.
